Minimum Python Version
======================

The minimum required version of Python has been upgraded to 3.10. This is in line with
the `NumPy deprecation policy
<https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html>`_.


.. _whatsnew-6.1-ascii-default-int-columns-as-int64:

``io.ascii`` uses 64-integers by default for integer columns
============================================================

:mod:`~astropy.io.ascii` now uses a 64-bit integer field by
default when reading a column of integer numeric data. This changes the default behavior
on Windows and potentially 32-bit architectures. Previously on those platforms, table
columns with any long integers which overflowed the 32-bit integer would be returned
as string columns. The new default behavior is consistent with ``numpy`` v2 and ``pandas``.


Updates to `~astropy.cosmology`
===============================

|Cosmology| as a :func:`~dataclasses.dataclass`
-----------------------------------------------

The :class:`~astropy.cosmology.Cosmology` class is
now a :func:`~dataclasses.dataclass`. This means that the :mod:`dataclasses` machinery
can be used to work with :class:`~astropy.cosmology.Cosmology` objects. For example::

    >>> from dataclasses import make_dataclass, field, fields
    >>> from astropy.cosmology import Cosmology
    >>> NewC = make_dataclass("NewC", [("newfield", float, field(default=None))],
    ...                       bases=(Cosmology,), frozen=True, eq=False)
    >>> [f.name for f in fields(NewC)]
    ['name', 'meta', 'newfield']
