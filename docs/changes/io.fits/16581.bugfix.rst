Fixed a crash that occurred for files opened via
``fits.open(..., mode='update')``, on Windows, and with numpy 2.0 installed.
A warning is now emitted in cases most likely to escalate into
undefined behavior (e.g., segfaults), i.e., when a closed memory map object is
still referenced by external code. Please report any regression found.
